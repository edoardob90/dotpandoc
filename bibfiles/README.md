# Bibliography files

*1.11.2018*

Personal folder where I will store various BibTeX/BibLaTeX `.bib` files. These are meant to be:

1. kept up to date with Zotero, via the plugin *Better BibLaTeX* which allows the constant update of an exported `.bib` file;
2. searched automatically by any project which gets converted to LaTeX through the workflow: *(Scrivener +) MultiMarkdown + Pandoc{omatic}*. The default `pandocomatic.yaml` configuration file will look in this folder if the `bibliography` YAML list has been set up.
